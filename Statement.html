<h1> Where am I?</h1>

<p> This project named "Where am I" is based around the feeling of being lost, confused and isolated. You dont know where your going or what you'll find. I used movement as a way for you to explore the pages and find the hidden texts and links throughout. Some lead you on and others bring you back to the beginning. I interpreted the theme of location as not knowing your own. Your placed in this site without any backstory or lead. I wanted to create something simplistic in design and very retro based. I explored different techniques to create new feelings as you scroll through and move around the different pages. Overall creating a site making you want to check all the corners and every pixel throughout. Something artistic but with limited visuals so your relying more on the text throughout .In the future I would further this project by creating more interactions and adding more pages linked through to lead you on a a longer exploration.  <p>
